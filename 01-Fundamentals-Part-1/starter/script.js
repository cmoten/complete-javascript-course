//Operators allow us to transform or combine values

//Assignments


///// Start Assignment 1 /////
//1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and

//country (population in millions)

//2. Log their values to the console

const continent = "North America";

///// End Assignment 1 /////

///// Start Assignment 2 /////
//1. Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable'language', but don't assign it any value yet

///// Start Assignment 3 /////
//1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)
language = "English";

//2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.

//3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens

// country = "Germany";

///// End Assignment 3 /////

///// Start Assignment 4 /////
